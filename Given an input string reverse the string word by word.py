 '''The optimal approach tries to swap the words of the string from the beginning and end, using a two-pointers-based approach, to reverse the string in constant space. The algorithm is as follows:

Convert the string into an array of strings, which will store the words.
Initialize the 2 pointers left and right to 0 and string.length() â€“ 1 respectively.
While the left pointer does not exceed the right pointer, swap the elements at the left and right pointer, move the left pointer forward and the right pointer backward by 1 place.
Finally, return the final calculated string.
